<h1>Hiking Adventure</h1>
<h2> December 11 2002</h2>
<body>
 I went to climb the mountains in Norway.
 Hiking to me is very "kos", which is "having a pleasing time".
I had my hiking gear and traversed a good section of the northern mountains.
There I stayed until nightfall so I could see the northern lights.
The nortern lights illuminated the sky as I hiked back towards the capital of Oslo.

<h1> Kayaking Through the Fjords</h1>
<h2> December 13 2002</h2>
As I left Oslo again, I made my way northeast towards the fjords of Norway.
I stopped along near some of the port cities, since some of them have old homes and traditions that are neat.
As I got near the fjords, I rented a kayak so I could travel through the waterways the fjords created. 
I had a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat, since the air around the water was very cold.
As I kayaked through the clear water I came across a few parts of some glaciers.
The parts were pretty massive and I had no real way of getting on top of the glaciers or near them.

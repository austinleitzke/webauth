<h1>Hiking Adventure</h1>
<h2> December 11, 2002</h2>
<body>
 I went to climb the mountains in Norway.
 Hiking to me is very "kos", which is "having a pleasing time".
I had my hiking gear and traversed a good section of the northern mountains. "IMAGE"
There I stayed until nightfall so I could see the northern lights. "IMAGE"
The nortern lights illuminated the sky as I hiked back towards the capital of Oslo.

<h1> Kayaking Through the Fjords</h1>
<h2> December 13, 2002</h2>
I left Oslo again, I made my way northeast towards the fjords of Norway. "IMAGE"
I stopped along near some of the port cities, since some of them have old homes and traditions that are neat. "IMAGE"
As I got near the fjords, I rented a kayak so I could travel through the waterways the fjords created. 
I had a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat, since the air around the water was very cold.
As I kayaked through the clear water I came across a few parts of some glaciers.
The parts were pretty massive and I had no real way of getting on top of the glaciers or near them.
 
<H1>Museums</H1>
<h2>December 15, 2002</h2>
I heard about some the museums that Norway had.
I decided to head to the Tromso's Arctic Museum.
They had all of the snow clothing that the people wore before in the past.
They also showed some of the vikings that lived in Norway. 
I got pretty interested in the vikings, so I decieded to go to the Viking Ship Museum. 
They showed the merchant and the war ships that they used. 
They also offered us to row and operate some of the replicas they had of the ships.
They showed us how to operate them, otherwise we would "skjerp deg" which is making a fool of ourselves.
They seem "texas" to us, which means crazy, but it seemed to work.
We got in the ship and managed to operate it.

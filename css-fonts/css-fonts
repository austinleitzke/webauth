    5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,

    “Never will I leave you;
        never will I forsake you.”[a]
    
    6 So we say with confidence,
    
    “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
        What can mere mortals do to me?”[b]
